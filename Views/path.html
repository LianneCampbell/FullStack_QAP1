    <p><b>Path</b>
        The path module in Node.js provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It offers a way to handle and transform file paths in a platform-independent manner, which is particularly useful when working with file systems on different operating systems.
        <br>
        Usage:
        
        Join different segments of a path to create a valid path string.
        Resolve absolute paths.
        Extract parts of a path such as directory name, file name, and file extension.
        Normalize paths to remove redundant segments like . and ...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>path.join() - concatenates path segments, handling any necessary path separators.</li>
            <li>path.resolve() - generates an absolute path by resolving a sequence of path segments.</li>
            <li>path.dirname() - returns the directory portion of a path.</li>
            <li>path.basename() - returns the last portion of a path, which is typically the file name.</li>
            <li>path.extname() - returns the file extension.</li>
            <li>path.normalize() - cleans up a path by resolving . and .. segments.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The path module is an essential part of Node.js that helps in handling and manipulating file paths in a cross-platform manner. 
    <br>It provides various methods to join, resolve, parse, format, and normalize paths, making it easier to work with file system paths regardless of the operating system. 
    <br>Understanding and using the path module effectively can help prevent bugs related to file path handling and improve the portability of your Node.js applications.</p>
