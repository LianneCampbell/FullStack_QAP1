        <h3>Node modules we have used for this project:</h3>
        <p><b>HTTP</b>
            The http module in Node.js allows for the creation of web servers and making HTTP requests. It provides functionalities to handle HTTP requests and responses, making it essential for building web applications and APIs.
            <br>
            Usage:
            
            Create an HTTP server that listens for requests on a specified port.
            Handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses back to the client.
            Make HTTP requests to other servers.</p>
            <br>
        <br><p><b>Filesystem (fs)</b>
            The fs module provides an API for interacting with the file system. It allows you to read from, write to, and manipulate the file system.
            <br>
            Usage:
            
            Read and write files synchronously and asynchronously.
            Manipulate file paths and directories.
            Watch for changes in the file system.</p><br>
            <br><p><b>Path</b>
            The path module in Node.js provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It offers a way to handle and transform file paths in a platform-independent manner, which is particularly useful when working with file systems on different operating systems.
            <br>
            Usage:
            
            Join different segments of a path to create a valid path string.
            Resolve absolute paths.
            Extract parts of a path such as directory name, file name, and file extension.
            Normalize paths to remove redundant segments like . and ...</p>
